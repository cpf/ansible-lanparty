lp-collectd
---

Installer for `collectd-core`. The package comes without any configuration,
so it's exactly what we need.

The role creates `/etc/collectd.d`, and renders a boilerplate configuration
to `/etc/collectd/collectd.conf` other roles (like `lp-gw`) drop their own
into `collectd.d/*.conf` and are included by `collectd.conf`.

InfluxDB Back-end
---

At present, the only configuration variables are:

```
collectd_targets:
  example:
    address: 1.2.3.4
    port: 25826
```

`collectd_targets` defaults to an empty hash and needs to be set in order for
the `network` plugin to be activated. `port` defaults to 25826.

Skipping Configuration
---

The collectd-core package needs to be installed on InfluxDB servers as it
installs the `/usr/share/collectd/types.db` required by any InfluxDB instance
wishing to accept data from our collectd clients.

`lp-influxdb` relies on this role to provide `types.db` to the influxdb server.
When run with `skip_config` enabled, this role will not render a config file.
This way, `types.db` is guaranteed to be updated throughout package upgrades.
